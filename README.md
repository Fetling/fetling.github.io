This some what of a tutorial for the template on github.com on how fetling created his github.io website
The domain link will be your username then github.io for example: username.github.io

Here are the app requirements for this to work:
Visual Studio Code (or any text editing coding app that is common for most users)
GitHub Desktop

Now this is the part where I get lazy writing the entire tutorial
Go to the website: pages.github.com

Scroll down to "You get one site per GitHub account or organization and unlimited project sites. Let's get started!"
and select user or organization site. If you want a project site then you can't use this template.

You also have to select GitHub Desktop since this is a requirement for this tutorial
"What git client are you using?": GitHub Desktop
And follow the instructions!

My website was inspired by astricz (https://astricz.info/)
To get a custom domain you need to buy one for DNS requirements or something.
